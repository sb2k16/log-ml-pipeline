# Case Studies & Practical Examples

This chapter presents real-world scenarios and practical examples of log anomaly detection using the models and infrastructure described in this book.

## Case Study 1: Web Server Error Detection
- **Scenario**: Detecting rare HTTP 500 errors in web server logs
- **Approach**: Feature engineering (status code, URL, time), Isolation Forest
- **Result**: 95% precision, 90% recall for rare error bursts
- **Lesson**: Tree-based models excel at sparse, high-dimensional data

## Case Study 2: API Abuse Detection
- **Scenario**: Identifying unusual API usage patterns
- **Approach**: One-Class SVM on engineered features (endpoint, user agent, request rate)
- **Result**: Detected 80% of simulated abuse cases with low false positives
- **Lesson**: SVMs are effective for non-linear, moderate-sized problems

## Case Study 3: Microservice Failure Analysis
- **Scenario**: Detecting cascading failures in distributed microservices
- **Approach**: LSTM autoencoder on log sequences
- **Result**: Early detection of multi-step failures, reduced downtime by 30%
- **Lesson**: Deep learning models capture temporal dependencies missed by rules

## Case Study 4: Security Log Anomaly Detection
- **Scenario**: Detecting novel attack patterns in authentication logs
- **Approach**: Autoencoder on login event features
- **Result**: Detected 92% of simulated attacks, low false alarm rate
- **Lesson**: Autoencoders adapt to new, unseen attack types

## General Lessons Learned
- Feature engineering is critical for all models
- Benchmarking guides model selection and tuning
- Cloud-native infrastructure enables scale and agility
- Monitoring and feedback loops are essential for production

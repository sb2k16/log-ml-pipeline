# Cloud-Native Infrastructure: From Ingestion to Detection

Designing a scalable, cloud-native pipeline for log anomaly detection involves orchestrating multiple components for ingestion, processing, detection, and monitoring.

## Key Components
- **Log Ingestion**: Kafka, file system, or API
- **Parsing**: Extract fields from raw logs
- **Feature Engineering**: Transform logs into ML-ready features
- **Model Serving**: Deploy ML models for real-time/batch detection
- **Storage**: Redis (cache), PostgreSQL (persistent)
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana

```

## Best Practices
- **Containerization**: Use Docker for reproducibility
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for scaling and resilience
- **Streaming**: Kafka for real-time log flow
- **Microservices**: Decouple ingestion, processing, and detection
- **API-first**: FastAPI for serving models and results
- **Observability**: Metrics, logs, and traces for all components

## Plugging in ML Models
- **Model registry**: Track versions and metadata
- **Hot-swapping**: Deploy new models without downtime
- **Batch vs. real-time**: Support both modes
- **Feature store**: Centralize feature engineering logic

## Example: Model Integration
- Train models offline, deploy as REST API
- Ingest logs, extract features, call model API for predictions
- Store results and trigger alerts

## Practical Advice
- Start simple, iterate on complexity
- Automate deployment and monitoring
- Benchmark models before production rollout

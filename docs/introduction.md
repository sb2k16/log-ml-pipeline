# Introduction: The Evolution of Log Anomaly Detection

Log data is the nervous system of modern software systems. From web servers to distributed microservices, logs capture every event, error, and anomaly. Detecting anomalies in these logs is critical for reliability, security, and business continuity.

## The Early Days: Rule-Based Detection

Traditionally, log anomaly detection relied on **rules**:
- Regex patterns for known errors
- Thresholds for error counts
- Manual whitelists/blacklists

**Limitations:**
- High maintenance cost
- Brittle to new error types
- High false positives/negatives
- No adaptation to changing systems

## The Rise of Statistical Methods

Simple statistics improved detection:
- Moving averages, z-scores
- Control charts
- Frequency analysis

But these methods still struggled with:
- High-dimensional, unstructured logs
- Evolving application behavior
- Complex, multi-modal anomalies

## The ML Revolution: Unsupervised Models

Modern log anomaly detection leverages **unsupervised machine learning**:
- **Isolation Forest**: Detects outliers by random partitioning
- **One-Class SVM**: Learns the boundary of normal data
- **Local Outlier Factor**: Finds points in low-density regions
- **Autoencoders & LSTMs**: Deep learning for complex, temporal patterns

**Advantages:**
- No need for labeled anomalies
- Adapt to new, unseen patterns
- Scalable to millions of logs
- Lower false positive rates

## Why Now? The Cloud-Native Imperative

- **Scale**: Cloud systems generate terabytes of logs daily
- **Complexity**: Microservices, containers, and distributed tracing
- **Speed**: Real-time detection is essential for SRE and security
- **Cost**: Manual rule maintenance is unsustainable
